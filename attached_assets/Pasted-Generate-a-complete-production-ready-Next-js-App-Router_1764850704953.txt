Generate a complete, production-ready **Next.js  (App Router)** personal portfolio website project for me. Make the site visually premium and modern, inspired by the Mozilla Firefox welcome page style: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/welcome/26/

--- REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY ---
- Next.js 14 (App Router) — JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion for animations
- shadcn/ui for polished UI components
- next-themes for dark/light toggling (persistent in localStorage)
- JSON-driven dynamic data for projects, experience, skills, etc.
- Contact form that posts to an API route using Nodemailer (dummy Gmail credentials)
- Resume support — I will upload `RESUME.pdf` into `public/`
- Optionally include project screenshot, GitHub link, and live preview URL in project entries
- Ready-to-deploy instructions for Vercel (with `.env.local.example`)

--- DESIGN & UX ---
- Premium color theme (provide an attractive default palette + accent colors)
  Example palette: midnight navy (#0b1220) background, indigo gradient accents, cyan highlights, warm peaches for CTA.
- Big bold typography, glassmorphism cards, soft glows, subtle parallax and reveal animations
- Bento grid for projects, smooth scroll, and accessible layout
- Responsive at all breakpoints
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, keyboard-focus styles, aria labels for form

--- ADDITIONAL FEATURES (must be included) ---
1. **Better Color Theme** — implement a cohesive Tailwind config theme & CSS variables for easy edits
2. **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** — use `next-themes`. Toggle persists to `localStorage`. Add an icon toggle in the navbar and automatic system-preference detection.
3. **shadcn/ui Integration** — use shadcn components (Button, Card, Input, Textarea, Toast) for consistent top-tier UI. (You can scaffold minimal shadcn usage without requiring their full generator if necessary — just import and use components styled with Tailwind.)
4. **Deployable** — include a small `DEPLOY.md` section describing how to deploy to Vercel, what env vars are needed (GMAIL_USER, GMAIL_PASS, TO_EMAIL), and how to test contact email.

--- PAGES & ROUTES ---
Create these pages in `/app`:
- `/` (Home) — hero with name “Mohammed Faseeullah”, subtitle "Full Stack Developer (MERN • Node.js • Fastify • PostgreSQL)". CTAs: “View Resume” (open `/public/RESUME.pdf`) and “Contact Me”. Featured projects preview (from JSON).
- `/about` — bio, skills chips, experience timeline (driven from `data/constants.js`), embedded resume viewer.
- `/projects` — paginated/bento grid of project cards (driven by JSON constants). Each card supports optional `screenshot`, `github`, `previewUrl`. Add modal or detail page for "Learn More".
- `/contact` — contact form with:
  - Fields: `email` (validated) and `message` (min length)
  - Optional `name` field
  - Client-side validation + server-side check
  - On submit: POST `/api/contact` with `{ email, name?, message }`
  - Success / Error toasts and UX states

Create API route:
- `/app/api/contact/route.js` (POST)
  - Use `nodemailer` with Gmail dummy creds fallback:
    ```
    const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
      service: 'gmail',
      auth: {
        user: process.env.GMAIL_USER || 'dummyemail@gmail.com',
        pass: process.env.GMAIL_PASS || 'dummyapppassword',
      }
    })
    ```
  - Send email to `process.env.TO_EMAIL || 'faseeullah.1998@gmail.com'`
  - Return JSON `{ success: true, message: "Email sent!" }` on success, and appropriate error JSON on failure.

--- TECH DETAILS & IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (must be followed) ---
- Use `next-themes` for theme switching; default theme should follow system preference.
- Implement theme CSS variables in `globals.css` and extend Tailwind with custom colors in `tailwind.config.cjs`.
- shadcn/ui: include imports and use at least Button, Card, Input, Textarea. If full shadcn setup is heavy, use a minimal shadcn-like component layer but use their naming & styling conventions (Button component with variants).
- Use `framer-motion` for hero entry, project card hover, and scroll reveal.
- Contact form should use `fetch()` to POST to `/api/contact`, show inline validation and toasts (success/error).
- Add simple analytics placeholder (commented) for future integration.
- Keep code modular and well commented so I can later customize content.

--- JSON DATA example format (in `data/constants.js`) ---
export const projects = [
{
id: 'p1',
title: 'Project Title',
description: 'Short summary of the project.',
stack: ['Next.js','Tailwind','Fastify'],
github: 'https://github.com/user/repo',
previewUrl: 'https://app.example.com',
screenshot: '/screenshots/p1.png' // optional; user may upload later
},
...
]
export const skills = ['React', 'Next.js', 'Fastify', 'PostgreSQL']
export const experience = [{ company, role, dates, location, bullets: [] }, ...]

--- ENV & RUN INSTRUCTIONS (add to project root) ---
`.env.local.example` must contain:
GMAIL_USER=dummyemail@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASS=dummyapppassword
TO_EMAIL=faseeullah.1998@gmail.com

sql
Copy code

Run locally / in Replit:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Upload `RESUME.pdf` into `/public`
4. Test contact form (it will attempt to send — with dummy creds it will likely fail; instruct how to set real creds or use SendGrid).

--- DEPLOY (DEPLOY.md) ---
- Connect repository to Vercel
- Add env vars in Vercel dashboard: `GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_PASS`, `TO_EMAIL`
- Build command: `npm run build`, output dir: default
- After deploy, test `/contact` to confirm emails. Suggest using SendGrid/Sendinblue for production (less friction than Gmail app passwords).

--- DELIVERY ---
Produce the complete file tree with full source code for all files listed above. The code must be copy-paste ready and runnable in Replit. Keep comments explaining where to swap values (e.g., set real Gmail creds or change `TO_EMAIL`).

--- EXTRA (optional but include if possible) ---
- Dark/Light demo toggle in the navbar with icons (sun / moon) and accessible labels
- A theme-switch animation
- Slight parallax on hero background
- A small "Deploy to Vercel" note with one-click instructions (if applicable)
